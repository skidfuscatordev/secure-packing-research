# PwnPacker: Attacking packing mechanics by hooking the ClassLoader
## Overview


Key Features
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Automatically detects and loads the appropriate native library based on the operating system.
Dynamic Class Loading: Loads and defines all classes from a specified JAR file.
Secure Native Class Definition: Uses Rust to handle class definitions securely, mitigating certain vulnerabilities.
Main Method Invocation: Capable of invoking the main method of a specified class, facilitating seamless execution.
Motivation
The Functional Mechanic of Hooking into the Class Loader
In the Java ecosystem, the class loader is a pivotal component responsible for dynamically loading Java classes into the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). By hooking into the class loader, ProtectedClassLoader intercepts the class loading process, providing fine-grained control over how classes are loaded and defined. This mechanism is functional and beneficial for several reasons:

Enhanced Control: Hooking into the class loader allows developers to customize the class loading process. This can include loading classes from unconventional sources, such as encrypted JAR files or network locations, providing flexibility beyond the standard class loader.

Security: By controlling the class loading process, ProtectedClassLoader can enforce security policies, such as verifying class integrity or restricting the loading of unauthorized classes. This helps prevent certain types of attacks that exploit class loading vulnerabilities.

Class Manipulation: Developers can manipulate class bytecode before defining the class in the JVM. This can be used for various purposes, such as injecting additional logging, performing bytecode transformations, or implementing custom class versioning schemes.

Circumventing Class Dumping
Class dumping refers to the practice of extracting and saving the bytecode of loaded classes, which can be used for reverse engineering or debugging. By hooking into the class loader, ProtectedClassLoader can implement mechanisms to circumvent class dumping:

Bytecode Encryption: Classes can be stored in an encrypted format within the JAR file. The class loader decrypts the bytecode at runtime before defining the class, preventing direct access to the raw bytecode.

In-Memory Operations: By handling all class loading operations in memory, ProtectedClassLoader avoids writing decrypted class bytecode to disk, making it significantly harder for malicious actors to intercept and dump the classes.

Custom Class Definition: Using Rust for class definition via JNI, ProtectedClassLoader can obscure the class loading process, making it more challenging for standard Java tools and techniques to intercept and dump the classes.

Technical Details
Java Component
The Java component, ProtectedClassLoader, extends ClassLoader and overrides the findClass method to load classes from a JAR file. It uses a native method loadClassNative to delegate the actual class definition to the Rust component.

Rust Component
The Rust component defines the loadClassNative method, which uses JNI to interact with the JVM. It securely handles the bytecode provided by the Java component and defines the class within the JVM.

Example Usage
Loading Classes: The loadJar method reads all .class files from the specified JAR file, converts them to byte arrays, and stores them in a map.
Finding Classes: The findClass method retrieves the bytecode from the map and uses the native loadClassNative method to define the class in the JVM.
Running the Main Method: The main method of the specified class is invoked, allowing seamless execution of the loaded classes.
Conclusion
ProtectedClassLoader provides a robust and flexible solution for dynamically loading and defining classes in Java. By hooking into the class loader, it offers enhanced control, security, and functionality, while also implementing measures to circumvent class dumping. This makes it an invaluable tool for developers looking to secure and customize the class loading process in their Java applications.
